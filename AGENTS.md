<coding_rules>
Write code for clarity first. Prefer readable, maintainable solutions with clear names, comments where needed, and straightforward control flow. Use high verbosity for writing code and code tools.
Your code should be well-written and easy to quickly review (e.g., appropriate variable names instead of single letters).

<documentation_rules>
Any change that may affect the coherence or accuracy of `README.md` must be followed by a review and update of `README.md` (in English) to keep it consistent and up to date.
